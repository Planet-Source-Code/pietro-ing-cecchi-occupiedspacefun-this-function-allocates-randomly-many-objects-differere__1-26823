### Description

Populates container (form or picture) with objects, using the 'non-occupied space' concept.

Any added item, while populating the container, takes some cells from the 'unoccupied space':

it is a very fast process. Accurate demo and function design. Don't miss it!

----

OccupiedSpaceFun demo features:

- 2 switchable containers for the objects

- viewable 'non-occupied space' cells

- design/run time object sizes

Thank you very much for your time and efforts Pietro !

It works very fine, except for one small thing:

My labels are all in different sizes, so it would

have to be some kind of combination of no-collision

and non-occupied space if i was to be able to

implement it :)

Best regards,

Gunnar.

----

This program has been written in Visual Basic 6.

I hope yow like the effort, have fun (ction...) :)
